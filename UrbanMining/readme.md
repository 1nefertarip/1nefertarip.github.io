# Urban Mining Map of Leiden
Welcome to the Urban Mining Map of Leiden, focused on the potential economic value of extracting Copper and Steel from the city's built environment. This map is based on the Prospecting the Urban Mines of Amsterdam (PUMA) framework, which is a methodology for estimating the metal content of buildings using data sourced from the Basisregistratie Adressen en Gebouwen (BAG). This map is designed to help identify potential areas for the recovery and reuse of valuable Copper and Steel materials from the city's built environment. Urban mining is the process of extracting useful materials from buildings, infrastructure, and other human-made structures. By identifying and targeting these areas, we can not only help to conserve natural resources but also reduce the environmental impact of traditional mining practices and contribute to the city's economy. This map includes information on the potential economic value of urban mining Copper and Steel in various locations throughout the city.
